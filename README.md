The "Prediction Using Flask and Machine Learning" project is a web application that combines the power of machine learning with the simplicity of the Flask web framework to create a user-friendly prediction platform. By utilizing Flask, the project provides a lightweight and efficient backend for handling user input and routing, while integrating a pre-trained machine learning model to generate real-time predictions. Users can enter their data through an intuitive web interface, and the backend processes this information to provide relevant predictions, which are then displayed in an easy-to-understand format. The frontend is crafted using HTML and CSS to ensure a visually appealing user experience. This project serves as an excellent demonstration of how machine learning can be integrated into web applications to solve real-world problems, such as predicting prices, outcomes, or trends, making it an engaging and practical learning tool for those interested in data science and web development.
